Khanh wants to use software engineering to foster community engagement and spread kindness in the world. This is the prototype version and will be graded as Khanh's final project for his class COM214 - Web Technology and Mobile Computing. More features to come!</p>

                <h4><b>Objective of the web site</b></h4>
                <p>Gilit provides a platform to utilize human resources in a local community, allowing people to give and receive help without monetary incentives. It aims to foster community engagement and spread kindness in the world.</p>
                <h4><b>Description of the web site and target audience.</b></h4>
                <p>The website asks the user to register for an account and choose a local community to join. If the user already has a community, s/he can look at the Community Board. The Community Board has all the posts from the members of the community. Each community has at least 1 admin. Right now, Gilit does not allow registration for new admin account due to verification difficulty. Each user starts out with 0 points, and can gain points by commiting to help. Future plan: Only getting points when task marked as completed. If the user has more than 0 point, s/he can post on the community board and ask for help.</p>
                <p>The current target audience of Gilit is the Conn Coll community.</p>
                <h4><b>Description of design considerations and aesthetics.</b></h4>
                <p>The design is minimalist, using the Bootstrap framework for mobile device friendliness. Navigation is simple. The experience in this prototype is quite linear.</p>
                <h4><b>Nature of information exchange with the server.</b></h4>
                <p>There are 3 databases - users, coms, and posts - all connected by integer id keys. All content is dynamically pulled from the database.</p>
                <h4><b>Operations performed on the server.</b></h4>
                <p>To pick a local community, the database takes the geolocation of the user and the lat and long of the community to compute the distance in miles. The database return the nearest community. Gilit also uses other basic operations on a MySQL databased: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE...</p>
